First go to the Gobot Intel Edison Readme (https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/tree/master/platforms/intel-iot/edison#how-to-install)  and follow the getting started guide. Your Edison has already been updated to the latest firmware version,   
so you can skip that part! You will not need to download the Intel XDK, you only need to go through the steps detailing how to connect through the serial interface and then configure your edison.

Find the box called "Base Shield" and open that up and place the grove "Base Shield" onto your Intel  Edison. This will allow you to  use the Grove connectors shields and cables!
